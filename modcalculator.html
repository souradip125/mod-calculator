         <span>This calculator is very much useful while finding remainder of two numbers.
             I have seen lot of programming questions related to modulo operation.While Calculating modulo 
             its quite difficult to find remainder by your own.Here Put two numbers and calculate easily.Give me your 
             feedback.That will help me to find Bugs and your opinion to improve .Thank You to All.

            <h3>Do You Know About Modulo operation?</h3>
            <span>
                In computing, the modulo operation returns the remainder or signed remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another (called the modulus of the operation).

Given two positive numbers a and n, a modulo n (abbreviated as a mod n) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of a by n, where a is the dividend and n is the divisor.[1] The modulo operation is to be distinguished from the symbol mod, which refers to the modulus[2] (or divisor) one is operating from.

For example, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1, because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0, because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3.

(Here, notice that doing division with a calculator will not show the result of the modulo operation, and that the quotient will be expressed as a decimal fraction if a non-zero remainder is involved.)

Although typically performed with a and n both being integers, many computing systems now allow other types of numeric operands. The range of numbers for an integer modulo of n is 0 to n âˆ’ 1 inclusive (a mod 1 is always 0; a mod 0 is undefined, possibly resulting in a division by zero error in some programming languages)
